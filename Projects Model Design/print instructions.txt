80% infill works great for both parts. See updated model, the lever can now be printed on its side to 
optimize layer orientation as suggested by users. Print the connector with the face of the handlebar 
mount flat on the build plate (see other picture). Connector designed to fit on a 0.875" diameter handle bar. 
The handlebar mounting bolt is an M3 x 16. For the other hardware, anything that fits should be fine. 
I recommend embedding two M3 square nuts during the print of the connector to ensure the M3 bolt stays put when 
you do install on your bike.
